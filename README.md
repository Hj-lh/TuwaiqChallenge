# Program Completion Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a user will complete a given program based on various factors such as age, education level, employment status, and more. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical data to make these predictions. The project is designed for a competition where the task is to accurately forecast program completion across a test dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset includes several features that describe the user's demographic and educational background, as well as details about the program they are enrolled in. Note: The dataset is proprietary and not available for public distribution.

## Features
The dataset contains the following features:
- Age
- Gender
- Level of Education
- Employment Status
- Program ID
- Program Start and End Dates
- And several others...

## Preprocessing Steps
1. Handling missing values by imputation or dropping.
2. Dropping unnecessary columns that don't contribute to the model's predictive power.
3. Encoding categorical variables into one-hot encoded vectors.
4. Custom functions for imputing specific columns based on business logic.

## Model
The project uses a RandomForestClassifier for predicting program completion. This choice was made due to the model's ability to handle non-linear relationships and its robustness to overfitting with the provided dataset.

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and F1 score metrics to balance the precision and recall of the predictions.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, etc.
3. Run the preprocessing script to prepare your dataset.
4. Train the model using the provided notebook.
5. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

## Installation
To set up the project environment, run the following commands:
```bash
